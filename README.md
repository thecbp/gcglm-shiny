# gcglm-shiny

This is a Shiny dashboard for simulating and analyzing data from a Gaussian Copula Generalized Linear Model (GCGLM). 

The manuscript that inspired this small project is "A Bayesian approach to study design and analysis with type I error rate control for response variables of mixed types" by Alt et al. The credit for the source code for simulating and analyzing the GCGLM data goes majorly to the accompanying code for this manuscript. This code can be found [here](https://github.com/ethan-alt/gcglmpos).

This dashboard only provides a convenient interface for simulating data with your own specified covariates and outcomes. I made this in order to better understand the model because I thought it might be useful in my own research. 

# Stuff to implement
